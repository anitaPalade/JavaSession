Vector

Vector implements List Interface. Like ArrayList it also maintains insertion order but it is rarely used in non-thread environment as it is synchronized 
and due to which it gives poor performance in searching, adding, delete and update of its elements.

Method 1:

Vector vec = new Vector();
It creates an empty Vector with the default initial capacity of 10.
It means the Vector will be re-sized when the 11th elements needs to be inserted into the Vector. Note: By default vector doubles its size.


Method 2:

Vector object= new Vector(int initialCapacity)

Vector vec = new Vector(3);
It will create a Vector of initial capacity of 3.


Method 3:

Vector object= new vector(int initialcapacity, capacityIncrement)
Example:
Vector vec= new Vector(4, 6)
Here we have provided two arguments. The initial capacity is 4 and capacityIncrement is 6.
It means upon insertion of 5th element the size would be 10 (4+6) and on 11th insertion it would be 16(10+6)



Commonly used methods of Vector Class:

1.  void addElement(Object element): It inserts the element at the end of the Vector.
2.  int capacity(): This method returns the current capacity of the vector.
3.  int size(): It returns the current size of the vector.
4.  void setSize(int size): It changes the existing size with the specified size.
5.  boolean contains(Object element): This method checks whether the specified element is present in the Vector. If the element is been found it returns true else false.
6.  boolean containsAll(Collection c): It returns true if all the elements of collection c are present in the Vector.
7.  Object elementAt(int index): It returns the element present at the specified location in Vector.
8.  Object firstElement(): It is used for getting the first element of the vector.
9.  Object lastElement(): Returns the last element of the array.
10. Object get(int index): Returns the element at the specified index.
11. boolean isEmpty(): This method returns true if Vector doesnâ€™t have any element.
12. boolean removeElement(Object element): Removes the specifed element from vector.
13. boolean removeAll(Collection c): It Removes all those elements from vector which are present in the Collection c.
14. void setElementAt(Object element, int index): It updates the element of specifed index with the given element.
